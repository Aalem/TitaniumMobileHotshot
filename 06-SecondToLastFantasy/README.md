This chapter guides the reader in creating a native mobile game. The game slows players to roam around a map from a tip view perspective, much like a classic Japanese RPG. It covers graphics manipulation and touch control.

###Topics covered: 
- Creating the map  
- Creating the main character 
- Having him move around the map
- Loading game assets into a game
- Interacting with the game using touch events

By the end of this chapter, readers will have a barebones game that allows the player to move freely around the map.
